# lexxer

This is a clone of lexica, a word finding game. You have a given amount of time to find as many words as 
possible from a grid by connnecting adjacent letters (click and drag mouse over letters). Points are given 
based on length of word. Whether an answer is a word or not is determined by comparison to a dictionary file.

Made in Java 8 with JavaFX. Dictionary search is done with [alphaSort](https://github.com/jsheradin/alphaSort).
