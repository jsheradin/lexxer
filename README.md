# lexxer

This is a clone of lexica, a word finding game. You have a given amount of time to find as many words as 
possible from a grid by connnecting adjacent letters. Points are given based on length of word. If an 
answer is a word is determined by comparison to a dictionary file.

Made in Java 8 with JavaFX. Dictionary search is done with [alphaSort](https://github.com/jsheradin/alphaSort).
